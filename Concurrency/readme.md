Go is well-suited for Concurrency because of its lightweight Goroutines and built-in Channel type. Goroutines are lightweight threads that can be created easily and have low overhead, allowing for the efficient creation of thousands or even millions of concurrent processes. Channels are built-in data structures that facilitate communication between Goroutines, enabling safe and efficient synchronization of data access.
