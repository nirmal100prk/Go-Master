## The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information. AES is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data.

Symmetric encryption algorithm : uses same key to encrypt and decrypt

Splits the message into small blocks and encrypts those blocks to convert plaintext into cyphertext

Keys : 128, 192,256 (bit)

128 - provides adequate security
192,256 - stronger security, requires more processing power and takes longer to execute

AES includes three block ciphers or cryptographic keys:

AES-128 uses a 128-bit key length to encrypt and decrypt message blocks.
AES-192 uses a 192-bit key length to encrypt and decrypt message blocks.
AES-256 uses a 256-bit key length to encrypt and decrypt message blocks.
