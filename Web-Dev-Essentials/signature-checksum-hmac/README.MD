## Signature checksum

Used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being transmitted
Achieved by generating a digital signature or Hash based Message Authentication Code(HMAC) of the request data
This signature can be send along the request to ensure the data has not been tampered with 

Hashing is different from encryption as it is a one-way function. This can be used for verifying data integrity and authenticity.

## HOW HMAC works?
Cryptographic authentication technique that uses a hash function and a secret key

HMAC consists of hash functions and cryptographic keys

A pair using this system must agree on secret keys and algorithms
