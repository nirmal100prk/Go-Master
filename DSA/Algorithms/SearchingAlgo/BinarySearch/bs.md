Binary Search Algorithm is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N). 

worst case O(log N)

The Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in the following two ways

Iterative Binary Search Algorithm
Recursive Binary Search Algorithm
