Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted output.


Insertion sort is considered a stable sorting algorithm because it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output. Â  

This means that if two elements have the same value, their order in the input array will be the same as their order in the output array
